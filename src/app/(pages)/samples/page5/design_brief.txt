This brand brief captures the energy, flavor, and mobility of the "Holy Guacamole" food truck. The focus is on creating a fun, memorable identity that prioritizes fresh ingredients and the urgency of street food culture.

1. Brand Overview & Persona
Brand Name: Holy Guacamole

Industry: Food Truck / Mexican Street Food

Concept: Authentic Mexican street flavors served with a vibrant, modern, and slightly cheeky twist. We prioritize fresh, high-quality ingredients—especially our namesake avocados. We aren't just selling tacos; we're selling a spontaneous, delicious moment in your day.

Brand Voice: Enthusiastic, flavor-obsessed, irreverent, fun, and welcoming. We take our food seriously, but never ourselves.

Tagline Ideas:

Bless Your Tastebuds.

Worship the Taco.

Fresh. Fast. Divine.

2. Visual Identity: Color Scheme
The palette is designed to be appetizing, high-energy, and easily spotted from down the street. It leans heavily on fresh ingredient colors with a pop of fiesta energy.

Primary Color: "Avocado Smash" (Hex: #7CB342) - A vibrant, fresh green representing our core ingredient and freshness.

Secondary Color: "Fiesta Pink" (Hex: #E91E63) - A hot, energetic pink often found in Mexican folk art. It provides striking contrast to the green and adds a sense of fun.

Accent Color: "Street Corn Gold" (Hex: #FFC107) - A warm, inviting yellow representing masa, sunshine, and corn.

Neutral/Background: "Crema" (Hex: #F5F5F5) - An off-white/light cream for website backgrounds and menus to ensure readability without the harshness of pure white.

Text/Dark Accent: "Charcoal Grill" (Hex: #212121) - A deep, almost-black gray for primary text and logo outlines.

3. Typography (Font Choice)
The fonts need to balance a hand-painted street sign feel with high readability on mobile devices.

Headline / Logo Font: Shrikhand

Style: A bold, retro, expressive display script with curves that mimic sauces and satisfying fullness. It feels boisterous and friendly.

Usage: Main logo, section headers on the website, menu item titles.

Body / Utility Font: Montserrat

Style: A geometric, highly legible sans-serif font. It is clean, modern, and works perfectly on small screens (crucial for customers looking up a food truck on their phone).

Usage: Paragraph text, menu descriptions, location details, buttons.

4. Logo Design Conceptualization
Style: Illustrative badge style with a hand-drawn feel, laid out horizontally for versatile use on the side of a truck, website headers, and bumper stickers.

Visual Description: On the far left, there is a stylized illustration of a halved avocado with the pit still in it. Hovering just above the avocado pit is a glowing golden halo (the "Holy" element).

To the immediate right of the illustration is the brand name in the Shrikhand font, rendered in the "Charcoal Grill" color with a slight "Avocado Smash" green outline.

The word "HOLY" is smaller, perched slightly above.

The word "GUACAMOLE" is large and dominant below it.

A subtle banner ribbon in "Fiesta Pink" runs beneath the text, perhaps containing the tagline "EST. 2024" or "STREET TACOS."

5. Information Design Structure (Site Architecture)
For a food truck, the website needs to be mobile-first and action-oriented. Customers usually have two immediate questions: "What do they have?" and "Where are they right now?"

The structure is designed as a scrolling "One-Pager" for speed, with anchor links.

Hero Section (The Hook): Immediate vibe setting and main call to action (CTA).

The "Where At?" Bar (Crucial Utility): A dynamic, high-visibility section showing today's location.

The Menu Highlights: Quick overview of core offerings.

Catering/Contact Footer: Secondary business goal.
