						<p>
							Buzzword bingo, also known as bullshit bingo, is a bingo-style game 
							where participants prepare bingo cards with buzzwords and tick them 
							off when they are uttered during an event, such as a meeting or speech. 
							The goal of the game is to tick off a predetermined number of words 
							in a row and then signal bingo to other players.
