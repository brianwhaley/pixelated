Pixelated Technologies – Brand Style Guide
1. Brand Overview

Pixelated Technologies builds modern, efficient websites and digital solutions for small businesses in New Jersey and South Carolina. Your brand should feel:

Trustworthy

Tech-forward

Friendly and local

Clean and efficient

This guide proposes a full color system, typography recommendations, and usage guidelines.

2. Color Palette

Your primary color is #369 (hex shorthand for #336699). This is a strong, professional blue—excellent for trust and reliability.

Here is a suggested expanded palette:

Primary Color

Primary Blue: #336699
Use for brand identity, navigation, CTAs, headers, and key accents.

Secondary Color

Secondary Blue (light): #5FA8D3
A lighter, friendly complement for backgrounds, highlight boxes, and illustrations.

Accent Colors

You want two accents that keep the palette balanced and modern:

Accent 1 (Warm Contrast): #F2A900

A warm golden-yellow for buttons, highlights, alerts, and conversion-oriented elements.

Pairs well with the primary blue for energy.

Accent 2 (Fresh Neutral): #6EC6A8

A soft green-turquoise for secondary highlights, icons, or infographics.

Adds freshness without overwhelming the palette.

Neutral System

Neutrals help maintain clean, readable layouts.

Background Light: #F7F9FC

Soft, modern off-white for content areas.

Background Dark (for footers/contrast sections): #1F2A33

Professional blue-black for dark-mode sections.

Primary Text: #1A1A1A

Deep neutral gray/black for high readability.

Secondary Text: #4A4A4A

For subtitles, labels, secondary information.

3. Typography
Is Tahoma a good choice?

Tahoma is clean and readable, but it is:

Slightly outdated

Less branded

Not as modern as typical web startup typography

It works, but it doesn’t help Pixelated feel current or premium.

Recommended Approach

Use two fonts:

One for headers (modern, strong branding)

One for body text (clean, readable, neutral)

Recommended Font Pairings

These pairs are Google-Fonts-friendly, free, and versatile.

Option A — Clean + Modern

Header: Montserrat

Body: Inter or Roboto

This pair makes you look modern, tech-forward, and trustworthy.

Option B — Friendly + Professional

Header: Poppins

Body: Source Sans Pro

Great for small-business friendliness.

Option C — Corporate + Clean

Header: Open Sans SemiBold

Body: Open Sans Regular

Simple, unified, and professional.

If you want to keep Tahoma:

Keep Tahoma as the body font, and add a modern header font:

Header: Montserrat or Poppins

Body: Tahoma

This keeps your brand familiar while modernizing your visual presence.

Recommendation:
➡️ Use Montserrat (headers) + Inter (body).

4. Logo Usage

(If you want, I can also create a logo usage guide.)

Light background version uses primary blue.

On dark backgrounds, use white or light secondary blue versions.

Accent colors should never overpower the primary brand blue.

5. UI/UX Guidelines
Buttons

Primary buttons → Primary Blue background, white text

Hover → Slightly darker #2B547A or lighten for effect

Secondary buttons → Accent 1 (gold)

Links

Use primary blue or accent 1

Hover underline for accessibility

Shadows + Depth

Very light shadows (rgba(0,0,0,.08)) for cards

Clean, modern, minimal

6. Imagery Style

Clean, bright, and minimal

Include photos of small businesses, local towns, and the Lowcountry/NJ community

Use illustrations in blues, golds, and greens to match accents

7. Tone & Voice

Approachable

Local-focused

Expert but not overly technical

Always helpful, clear, and empowering
