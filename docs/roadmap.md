- [ ] find a better solution than to generate image via build script in amplify for json for sitemap creation
- [ ] **SocialCards Component**: Fix state initialization to track prop changes properly.
- [ ] **Modal Component**: Clarify content source pattern (accepts both `modalContent` and `children`).
- [ ] **Carousel Component**: Fix active card state reset when `props.cards` changes.
- [ ] **NerdJoke Component**: Add props to useEffect dependencies if endpoint becomes configurable.
- [ ] **GoogleReviews Component**: Add carousel/grid display modes.
- [ ] **GoogleReviews Component**: Add API key to config provider instead of hardcoding.
- [ ] **Instagram Component**: Add accessToken and userId to config provider for centralized API credentials.
- [ ] **Critters Integration**: Explore adding critters CSS inlining tool for improved page load performance and critical CSS optimization.

### Platform Enhancements
- [ ] **Project Scaffolding CLI**: Interactive CLI tool that generates complete Next.js projects with pixelated-components pre-configured, including routes.json, layout.tsx, package.json, and basic page structure
- [ ] **Template Marketplace**: Pre-built industry-specific templates (restaurant, law firm, contractor, etc.) that users can clone and customize
- [ ] **Configuration Wizard**: Step-by-step setup wizard that collects business info, generates site configuration, and creates initial content structure
- [ ] **Content Migration Tools**: Automated importers for WordPress, Squarespace, Wix, and other platforms to migrate content to pixelated sites
- [ ] **A/B Testing Framework**: Built-in experimentation system for testing different layouts, content, and CTAs with automatic winner selection
- [ ] **Personalization Engine**: Dynamic content delivery based on user behavior, location, and preferences
- [ ] **Hot Module Replacement for Configs**: Live preview of configuration changes without full rebuilds
- [ ] **Automated Dependency Updates**: Smart update system that tests component changes across all sites before deployment
- [ ] **Rollback System**: One-click rollback to previous versions with automatic database and asset restoration
- [ ] **Performance Budget Tracker**: Automated monitoring of Core Web Vitals with alerts when sites exceed performance budgets
- [ ] **ConfigBuilder SEO Enhancement**: Upgrade ConfigBuilder with AI-powered meta description generation, keyword optimization suggestions, and automated schema markup
- [ ] **Conversion Funnel Builder**: Visual funnel creation with automated tracking, A/B testing, and optimization recommendations
- [ ] **Automated Security Scanner**: Regular security audits with vulnerability detection and automated fixes
- [ ] **GDPR Compliance Toolkit**: Automated cookie consent, data mapping, and privacy policy generation
- [ ] **API Gateway**: Unified API management for connecting to CRM, email marketing, payment processors, and other business tools
- [ ] **Webhook Automation**: Event-driven automation for form submissions, new content, user registrations, and business workflows
- [ ] **Third-Party Sync Engine**: Bidirectional sync with tools like HubSpot, Mailchimp, QuickBooks, and project management systems
- [ ] **Testing Strategy for Config Failure Scenarios**: Comprehensive testing framework for config-dependent components and error handling
  - Test components with missing config providers
  - Test error pages without config dependencies
  - Test app initialization with invalid environment variables
  - Include chaos engineering tests that simulate config failures
- [ ] **Documentation Auto-Generator**: Automatically generated API docs, component usage guides, and deployment instructions

## Admin Feature Enhancements

### High Priority Refactoring (Development Speed Focus)
- [ ] **API Client Abstraction**: Create centralized `ApiClient` class with consistent error handling, caching, and retry logic to eliminate repeated fetch/error patterns across components.
- [ ] **Reusable SiteHealthTemplate Hook**: Extract `useSiteHealthData` hook to eliminate 80% of boilerplate code duplicated across 15+ site-health components.
- [ ] **SEO Integration Modularization**: Split 1, 193-line monolithic file into focused modules: `page-analyzer.ts`, `site-crawler.ts`, `header-analyzer.ts`, and `metric-scorers.ts`.
- [ ] **Component Memoization**: Add `React.memo` and `useMemo` to reduce unnecessary re-renders by 30-50% in large components.

### Medium Priority Improvements
- [ ] **Standardized Component Architecture**: Establish consistent patterns for component props interfaces, error/loading state management, event handling, and styling approaches.
- [ ] **Shared Type Definitions**: Create centralized type definitions in `src/types/` directory to eliminate duplicated interfaces across components.
- [ ] **Bundle Optimization**: Implement dynamic imports and tree shaking optimizations to reduce large bundle sizes and enable code splitting.

## Component Library Enhancements

### UI Component Architecture Standardization (High Priority)
- [ ] **Modal Component Modernization**: Replace direct DOM manipulation with React state-based modal using proper TypeScript interfaces.
- [ ] **Standardized Component Interface**: Create consistent component interfaces with `BaseComponentProps` and `InteractiveComponentProps` extending patterns.

### Image & Media Component Optimization (High Priority)
- [ ] **SmartImage Component Breakdown**: Split 223-line monolithic SmartImage component into composable parts: `Image.tsx`, `LazyImage.tsx`, `ResponsiveImage.tsx`, and `Media.tsx`.
- [ ] **Image Optimization Standardization**: Implement unified image optimization with error boundaries, loading states, and fallback handling.

### Configuration & State Management (Medium Priority)
- [ ] **Unified Configuration System**: Create centralized configuration with `ConfigContext.tsx`, `ConfigProvider.tsx`, `useConfig.ts` hook, and service-specific config modules.
- [ ] **Type-Safe Configuration**: Implement strict TypeScript interfaces with runtime validation for configuration objects.

### API Integration Standardization (High Priority)
- [ ] **CMS API Client**: Create standardized CMS API clients (`ContentfulClient.ts`, `WordPressClient.ts`) with base `ApiClient.ts` for consistent error handling.
- [ ] **Request Deduplication Hook**: Implement `useApi` hook with automatic deduplication and caching to prevent duplicate API calls.

### Component Composition Patterns (Medium Priority)
- [ ] **Compound Component Pattern**: Implement compound component patterns like `Form = { Root, Field, Submit, Error }` and `FormField = { Input, Label, Error }`.

### Testing Infrastructure (Medium Priority)
- [ ] **Testing Utilities**: Create comprehensive testing utilities including `renderWithProviders.tsx`, mock utilities for config and API, and component test helpers.
